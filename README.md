## Project summary (max 250 words)
In this project, we intend to learn about the impact on people's mental health in the United States after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used data collected from the CDC and related to Covid-19 mental health that has the indicators of anxiety or depression based on the reported frequency of symptoms in the United States. By analyzing and visualizing the data, we learned the average depression disorder rate among different groups, such as building time series charts based on states to see the growth of the depression disorder rate from 2020 through 2022. Also, we created simple linear models to do predictive analysis. We found out the model makes robust predictions on age group data where young people (18 - 29 years) have the highest depression disorder rate in both actual and predicted.
